This collection of programs displays the graph generated by an n-token accelerated Zeckendorf game. 
The data for these graphs is generated with c++ programs, while the GUI is a python program. 
For information on usage of the GUI, such as controls and parameters, see the documentation at the top of GraphColoring.py

<h4>Mac/ Linux:</h4>
First make sure that you have git, python, and the g++ compiler installed, then run the fpllowing command to copy the files from this repository to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/ThomasRascon/ZeckGame-DecisionRecursion.git

Then navigate to the folder where this repository is downloaded, and compile the c++ programs for use with the GUI. This is only ever necessary to do once: 
g++ -shared -o clibrary.so -fPIC -std=c++17 GraphStructure.cpp ZeckGame.cpp 

Then you may run the GUI with the following command:
python3 GraphColoring.py

<h4>Windows:</h4>
